**Swanee** is a side-scrolling cover shooter, set in a distant future rendition of San Francisco.

### -- Conceptual Summary --
The year is 4019 in the Common Era.  Cato Swanee, a freelancing guard for the prison-industrial complex is sent in to quell a massive  riot on the secluded prison island of Alcatraz, just off the coast of the independent island republic known as Saint Bohemia, a sprawling metropolis built from the ruins of post-apocolyptic San Francisco.  At the behest of his employer, Warden “Crawfish” Chang, Swanee, along with his friend and former partner, must brave a fetid industrial labrynth filled with triad gangsters, mobsters, and cyborg serial killers.  Whether the riot is peacefully resolved or turns into a massacre is up to Swanee, his friend Kaspar Mueller, and their small squad of policemen and prison guards.  **Swanee** places an emphasis on a compact, minimalistic narrative, optional but layered world-building, tight and polished gameplay and reactive mechanics and NPC's.

### -- Gameplay --
Core gameplay revolves around clearing of "nodes", locked down sectors of Alcatraz prison.  Vicariously put in charge of a crack team of lawmen, the player will need to use rudimentary commands to organize his/her squad throughout each level, coordinating movement, tactics, advances, retreats, and combat behavior.  The player his/herself can control either Swanee or Mueller, with each having a distinct playstyle and loadout that affect both gameplay progression and narrative events.

Warden “Crawfish” Chang (AKA Moonface, The Man in the Moon): Gives you instructions: is also final boss (he will ask you to give up right as you reach the mob boss, and that it is all under control.  Several endings.  You kill him and the mob boss, you kill him and join the mob, you kill the boss and are fired/arrested, you comply and everything goes back to normal (noir/canon ending)…
* All a plot to free Don, while allowing the warden to save face for his mayoral run (put down huge riot); The Don will vote rig/intimidate in exchange

Regardless: always have Cato Swanee and Kaspar Mueller (cyborg friend)

Cato Swanee: Private security consultant put in charge of crack team of justiciars/guards to quell prison riot; hired as guard due to labor shortage.  Former union buster/employee of the Finks.  Blackleg turned company man for Gold Mining company.

-possibly have Swanee become more and more disheveled every now and then, from suit and tie at first day of work to grizzled

￼

* Swanee’s pistol is a decommissioned arbiter’s laser; it can switch between weaker/lethal silenced, lethal and loud mode, & stun (silenced) mode
* Can switch between controlling Kaspar/Cato Swanee.
* Give orders like go to nearest cover, advance to next closest cover in direction that player is facing (no advance will be made if no cover is past the NPC)
    * Retreat is opposite of advance cover
* Suppress fire will cause NPCs to pop out of cover and unload their ammo, then pop out periodically regardless of enemy fire
* Take Cover: Will cause NPCS to stay behind cover completely and not pop out
* Stay Frosty: Will cause NPCS to NEVER pop out if there is firing or has been firing in last 1 second.
    * Hostiles will have a one of the above as its COMMANDING prerogatives, at random.
* Split up: will cause NPCS to be assigned y levels at random.  Some will go up floors/ladders, and there will be a max 2 NPC per cover (so NPCS will default advance if this is the group prerogative)
* Stick together: will cause NPCS to crowd around one cover source; when firing, like a firing squad (good for bosses/bullet sponges?)
* Unleash the hounds
* Call back the hounds
* Heal
    * Healer in team goes to heal team mate, regardless of fire/danger
* Default AI:
    * Very simple.  Will seek out nearest cover.  Will peak out when there is no NPC fire at its y, and then it will fire in direction of enemy NPCS (small overlap, i.e. will occasionally pop up if only 1-2 shots fired in last few seconds)
