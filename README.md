**Swanee** is a side-scrolling cover shooter, set in a distant future rendition of San Francisco.

### -- Conceptual Summary --
The year is 4019 in the Common Era.  Cato Swanee, a freelancing guard for the prison-industrial complex is sent in to quell a massive  riot on the secluded prison island of Alcatraz, just off the coast of the independent island republic known as Saint Bohemia, a sprawling metropolis built from the ruins of post-apocolyptic San Francisco.  At the behest of his employer, Warden “Crawfish” Chang, Swanee, along with his friend and former partner, must brave a fetid industrial labrynth filled with triad gangsters, mobsters, and cyborg serial killers.  Whether the riot is peacefully resolved or turns into a massacre is up to Swanee, his friend Kaspar Mueller, and their small squad of policemen and prison guards.  **Swanee** places an emphasis on a compact, minimalistic narrative, optional but layered world-building, tight and polished gameplay and reactive mechanics and NPC's.

### -- Gameplay --
Core gameplay revolves around clearing of "nodes", locked down sectors of Alcatraz prison.  Vicariously put in charge of a crack team of lawmen, the player will need to use rudimentary commands to organize his/her squad throughout each level, coordinating movement, tactics, advances, retreats, and combat behavior.  The player his/herself can control either Swanee or Mueller, with each having a distinct playstyle and loadout that affect both gameplay progression and narrative events.
