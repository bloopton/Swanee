The year is 4019 in the Common Era.  Cato Swanee, a freelancing guard for the prison-industrial complex is sent in to quell a massive  riot on the secluded prison island of Alcatraz, just off the coast of the indpendent island republic known as San Francisco.  At the behest of his employer, Warden “Crawfish” Chang, Swanee, along with his friend and former partner, must brave a fetid industrial labrynth filled with triad gangsters, mobsters, and cyborg serial killers.  Whether the riot is peacefully resolved or turns into a massacre is up to Swanee, his friend Kaspar Mueller, and their small squad of policemen and prison guards.
