>Swanee:Let's try to keep the killing to a minimum today.
>Mueller:What did [Warden Chang] want with you anyways?
>Swanee:The prison's on silent lockdown.  Chang's trying to keep things under wraps.
>Mueller:Where do we come in?
>Swanee:Heâ€™s giving me a handful of his men to settle the matter.
>Mueller:Sounds like a good time.
>Swanee:Peacefully, Mueller.  Peacefully.
